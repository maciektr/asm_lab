# Assembly laboratory
This repository contains simple programs implemented as part of "Programming in Assembler" course at AGH University of Science and Technology in Cracow.

<!-- All codes presented where created in assembler  for 16bit 8086 processor, compiled with nasm 2.14.02 and then linked with val linker under dosbox emulator.  -->
