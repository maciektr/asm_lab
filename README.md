# Assembly laboratory
This repository contains simple programs implemented as part of "Programming in Assembler" course at AGH University of Science and Technology in Cracow.

<!-- All codes presented where created in assembler  for 16bit 8086 processor, compiled with nasm 2.14.02 and then linked with val linker under dosbox emulator.  -->

## Table of Contents
| Code (link) | Task | Description | Target |
|:-----------:|:----:|:-----------:|:------:|
| [Hello world](https://github.com/maciektr/asm_lab/tree/master/codes/hello.asm) | Hello world | My first assembler program. Prints "hello world" and arguments from command line. | Written in 16-bit CPU8086 assembly. Compiled with NASM, linked with VAL under DOSBOX.
| [Xor encoding](https://github.com/maciektr/asm_lab/blob/master/code.asm) | XOR encoding | Program encodes file given by filename. It uses xor with passphrase from argument. The result is being written to output file given by filename. | Written in 16-bit CPU8086 assembly. Compiled with MASM under DOSBOX.
